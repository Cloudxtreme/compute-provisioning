Compute Provisioning Benchmark

Initiates compute instance provisioning requests and tracks the time required 
to fulfill these requests. Once complete, newly provisioned compute instances 
are destroyed.

RUNTIME PARAMETERS
The following runtime parameters are used by this benchmark:

* api                       REQUIRED: corresponds with a folder in ./apis.
                            Defines an implementation of a compute service 
                            provisioning API. Additional API specific 
                            runtime parameters are documented in READMEs in 
                            these folders
* api_endpoint              Optional API endpoint - may override the default 
                            API endpoint
* api_key                   REQUIRED: API key for the service being tested
* api_secret                REQUIRED: API secret for the service being tested
* debug                     [0|1] whether or not to enable debug statements in 
                            the output logs (default 0)
* os                        REQUIRED: Identifier of the OS image/template/AMI 
                            to provision compute instances with
* quantity                  the number of compute instances to request. 
                            Default 1
* region                    optional region identifier. reference service 
                            READMEs for valid regions
                            provisioning logic for a compute service
* timeout                   Amount of time (secs) before designating a request 
                            as timed out. Default is 1200
* type                      REQUIRED: the type of instance to provision.  
                            reference service READMEs for valid types
* verify                    Provisioning completion verification method. One of
                            the following:
                              api    timing stops when API confirms 
                                     provisioning completion (DEFAULT)
                              ping   timing stops when compute instance can be 
                                     pinged 
                              port_n timing stops when compute instance can be 
                                     connected to on port n (e.g; port_80)

RESULT METRICS
The following result metrics are produced by this benchmark (N is an 
incrementing value from 1 to 'quantity'):

* provision_cpuN          The CPU model for the provisioned instance (optional 
                          depending on the API and parameters used)
* provision_instance_idN  Service instance identifier
* provision_ipN           Instance IP address or hostname
* provision_request_idN   Service instance request identifier
* provision_statusN       success, timeout or fail
* provision_timeN         Time to provision in seconds (e.g. 30.9482)
